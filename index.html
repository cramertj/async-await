                <section>
                    Cool now we have it set so we have 2018 edition enabled automatically!
                </section>
                <section>
                    We also now have this example set so all we need to do to run it is
                    <pre><code>cargo run --bin waker</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    Okay create a file src/waker.rs and open it up
                </section>
                <section>
                    Add this to the top to enable the nightly features we need
                    <pre><code>#![feature(arbitrary_self_types, futures_api, pin)]</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    What's Rust code without some imports? Here's what we'll need
                    <pre><code>use std::sync::mpsc::{sync_channel, SyncSender};
use std::future::{Future, FutureObj};
use std::mem::PinMut;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::task::{
    Context,
    Executor,
    local_waker_from_nonlocal,
    Poll,
    SpawnObjError,
    Wake,
};</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    Alright so we need some kind of executor that can spawn Futures in order to create a Context
                    type. We won't be using it in this example so we'll create a stub to satsify our instatiable
                    overlord rustc.

impl Executor for Exec {

        -> Result&lt;(), SpawnObjError&gt;
    {
        Ok(())

                <section>
                    While this will let you see how this works under the hood you normally
                    should just tag functions or things with async.
                </section>
                <section>
                    Why? rustc will handle when tasks need to be woken up when polled or if
                    it's ready. You won't need to think about all the logic involved with that.
                </section>
                <section>
                    Let's create a simple type like so:

                </section>
                <section>
                    The Future when polled will return Poll::Pending the first time and Poll::Ready(()) the
                    second time it's polled
                </section>
                <section>
                    <pre><code>impl Future for MyFuture {
    type Output = ();
    fn poll(mut self: PinMut&lt;Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context)
        -> Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt;
    {
        if self.0 {
            return Poll::Ready(());
        }
        self.0 = true;
        cx.waker().wake();

                            Your goal is to create a Future that can wait n seconds and will print out

                            You will need std::time::{Instant, Duration};

                        <li>
                            You will need a new type and implement Future for it

                    Before we get started on this we need to cover a few things like
                    setting up the file, the Executor trait, and then what types you
                    will have for the whole thing
                </section>
                <section>
                    Open up that Cargo.toml and change it to have this in it:
                    <pre><code>[[bin]]
path = "src/tiny.rs"
name = "tiny"</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    To run this code all you need to run now is:
                    <pre><code>cargo run --bin waker</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    Okay create a file src/tiny.rs and open it up
                </section>
                <section>
                    Add this to the top to enable the nightly features we need
                    <pre><code>#![feature(async_await, await_macro, futures_api, pin)]</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    Here's all the imports you'll need:
                    <pre><code>use std::future::{Future, FutureObj};
use std::mem::PinMut;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::sync::mpsc::{
    sync_channel, 
    SyncSender, 
    SendError, 
    Receiver

                </section>
                <section>
                    Alright now let's add two type definitions you'll need
                </section>
                <section>
                    <pre><code>struct Exec {

                <section>
                    <pre><code>struct Task {
    future: Mutex&lt;Option&lt;FutureObj&lt;'static, ()&gt;&gt;&gt;;,

                <section>
                    These are all the types you'll need and get for this exercise. Let's cover how to
                    implement Executor, what it's used for, and the definition for our event loop.

                <section>
                    A little earlier we saw a stubbed out Executor. So what is it?
                </section>
                <section>
                    It's what spawns new Futures into your queue of Futures that need to be run
                </section>
                <section>
                    If a Waker puts Futures back in the queue then an Executor spawns them into it
                </section>
                <section>
                    So what does our implementation going to look like?

                        <li>
                            Once it has the task check that it has a future that can be executed

                <section>
                    We spent some time manually implementing a Future, but that was tedious. We had to
                    keep track of state, how to make sure it was ready, etc. That's too much work!

                    Here's a simple example with await!()

    println!("Second");
}
async fn third() {
    println!("Third");

                <section>
                    So now that we know it will execute a Future inside our function why is it a macro?

                    We still want to play around with it and nail down a good design. Choosing the interface

                <section>
                    Here's what it might look like

async fn third() {

                    It's a macro though. So what does that even look like?

                <section>

                    async/await are not hard! What's hard is getting Futures to run,
